<h1>How to play</h1>
Defeat the corruption before it changes the land completely.<br>
Convert natural resources to energy, and take back your land!<br>

<p>Left-click your tiles to shield it (transfer energy to it), and right-click to bring up the build menu.<br>
Left-click neutral or corrupted tiles to attack. You can only attack a tile if it is adjacent to a tile your own. Energy from your tiles will flow into the attacked tile.</p>

<h3>Capturing A Tile</h3>
<p>Click on any tile next to yours, preferably one with a low number (energy). The more energy a tile has, the harder it is to capture.<br> Energy will flow from your tile to the attacked tile. If your tile runs out of energy, left-click it to start transferring energy into it from your energy bank.</p><br>

<h3>Building a Plant</h3>
<p>Now you've captured the tile, you can use it to create more energy. There are 3 types of resources, with 3 levels of abundance:</p>

<p>Hopefully the tile you've caught has at least one resource. <br>
Right-click it and choose a plant; you'll probably only be able to afford a wind farm right now. <br>
Resources in higher abundance produce more energy. It'll start adding to your energy banks immediately.</p><br>

<h3>Looking After Your Buildings</h3>
<p>Plants will slowly start to decay. Right-click to repair it. Eventually, if not repaired, the building will turn to rubble, <br>
and the tile will need to be cleared before being built on again (you can still shield the tile however).</p>

<h3>The Corruption</h3>
<p>Once you've taken a few tiles and have energy coming in, you can start to attack the corruption. <br>
You will need to take all the corrupted tiles to win the game. Equally, the corruption will start to attack your tiles once you're adjacent to it.<br>
If the corruption takes over a tile with a building on it, that building will be turned to rubble.</p><br>

<h3>Spores</h3>
<p>The corruption can also attack your tiles by sending out spores. <img src="imgs/spore.png" alt="Spore" align="center"  style="padding:5px;"><br>
These attacks are weak, but can still take over your tiles if they are not properly shielded.</p><br>
